# Unity Save System
A game-ready generic solution for saving player progress. It supports profiles and snapshots, which is essential for any strategy game, but also can be used as a simple system for games as basic as mobile ones. It works by saving bit-encoded data to txt file, and then zip's it. Also it creates screenshot in the moment of saving, that can be used as thumbnail for a snapshot.
